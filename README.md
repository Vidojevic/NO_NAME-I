Super Mario style game written in C++, using SFML library and ECS architecture. It's only one short level but all mechanics are already implemented. To create a whole new level takes less then 30 minutes. It just needs a config file (.txt) to arrange all the tiles and enemies, give them their positions and new level is complete. It's my very first project, the design is poorly implemented thanks to my lack of expirience. Many things learned, some good expirience gained.
